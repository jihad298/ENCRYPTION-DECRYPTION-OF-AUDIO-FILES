# ENCRYPTION-DECRYPTION-OF-AUDIO-FILES
 In this project, an audio encryption system is developed as a real-time software application. 
 Basically, the audio is taken as an input and is encoded to be decoded by authenticated users only. 
The algorithm used to perform this cryptography is Advanced Encryption Standards (AES) algorithm in Python.
